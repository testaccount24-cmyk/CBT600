2006/02/21 MT  - Mike Tomkins fixed HPNSTST assembly.
2005/06/06 PW  - Update to the RECV REXX exec to generate datestamped
                 dataset names and include the unpacking of the REXX
                 library.
2005/06/05 PW  - Update to FTPC119 for APAR PK01634. See doc for
                 details.
2004/06/20 PW  - Update to FTPC118 for APAR PQ83055. See doc for
                 details.
               - Update to FTPC118L/FTPC119L jobs
                 to add SCEELKED library after prolonged argument
                 with IBM support over whether an z/OS 1.4 version
                 of APAR PQ42591 is needed. I said yes, they said
                 yes, they won. PQ42591 section in the doc was
                 updated.
2004/03/22 PW  - Change to FTPC119 to detect an error in the server
                 transfer duration field for transfers spanning
                 midnight prior to the fix for APAR PQ87028. Update
                 to documentation for this APAR.
2004/03/07 PW  - The compile JCL for FTCP119 was changed to specify
                 RENT for the FTPT119 (TESTMODE) object. This ensures
                 C writable static storage is supported when
                 the load modules comes from an APF authorised
                 linklist library.
2004/03/01 PW  - Fixed a bug in the MLWTO and ANFUXMSG ASM programs
                 which caused the WTO line length to be incorrect
                 if the last line is exactly 71 chars and ends in a
                 space. FTPC118/119 need to be relinked to pick
                 up this fix.
               - A very minor fix to FTPC118 which was highlighted
                 during testing of the line length problem (above).
               - Update to FTPC119 for addition of a program switch
                 which enables IP domain name resolution when run
                 in batch SMF print mode (TESTMODE).
2004/02/11 PW  - Update to FTPC119 for APAR PQ80090.
               - The z/OS 1.2 compiler is now the default for FTPC119.
               - New C program NICKNC. This is a piece of fun designed
                 to generate English nicknames.
               - Minor update to contact details.
               - The following new programs are included.
                   - ANFUXMSG (ASM) An improved WTO message exit for
                     IBM Infoprint Server.
                   - HPNSTST (ASM) A program to 'IVP' TCPIP HPNS API.
                   - RXMAILER (REXX) A bulk emailer which opens a
                     socket connection to an SMTP server and transmits
                     SMTP format input data. This is similar in many
                     ways to UDSMTP, but RXMAILER has some interesting
                     features. It can simulate the sending of emails
                     to stress test an SMTP server and it can generate
                     parts of the SMTP commands, SMTP header and mail
                     data at run-time from symbolics (including
                     interpreted REXX) in the input file.
               - Minor update to doc and comments including tidy
                 up of formatting in $DOCFTPC to reduce file size.
               - Recompile of C programs to remove TEST option and
                 decrease object module size.
               - Documentation and JCL updated to include option
                 to use z/OS 1.2 C compiler for FTPC118/119.
               - Updated RECV exec to warn about replacing existing
                 libraries before executing RECEIVE command.

2002/10/30 PW  - Fixed a bug in fmtdsn() function of FTPC119.
               - Comments and doc updated to reflect FILE600 of CBT
                 Tape.
