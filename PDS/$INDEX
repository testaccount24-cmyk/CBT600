           FTPC119  - C program source for SMF type 119 (FTP)
                      batch print and SMF exit WTO program.
           NICKNC   - C program source for NICKNC -
                      an English nicknames generating program.
           SPRNTLLT - C program source which tests
                      and demonstrates the function
                      of the sprntll assembler function.
           WTOT     - C program source which tests
                      and demonstrates the function

XMITPDSO - XMIT unload of the object PDS.
XMITPDSR - XMIT unload of the REXX PDS (FB80). Contents as follows:-
           RXMAILER - A bulk emailer which opens a                      n
                      socket connection to an SMTP server and transmits
                      SMTP format input data. This is similar in many
                      ways to UDSMTP, but RXMAILER has some interesting
                      features. It can simulate the sending of emails
                      to stress test an SMTP server and it can generate
                      parts of the SMTP commands, SMTP header and mail
                      data at run-time from symbolics (including
                      interpreted REXX) in the input file.
