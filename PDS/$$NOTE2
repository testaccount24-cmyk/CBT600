Hi Sam,

It was a pleasure speaking with you.

The below attachments contain the assembler source and the SUPERC
output list for the HPNSTST program from Paul Wells.  I didn't
add any comments to the prolog in the source regarding the
change.

Warmest Regards, Mike

NOTE from S.GOLOB.  The fix required the changing around of R2 with
                    R9 in a few places.
