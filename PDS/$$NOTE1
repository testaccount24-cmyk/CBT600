Sam,



Please find the attached update to CBT file 600.  The changes are
as follows.



    * Update to FTPC119 for TCPIP APAR PQ80090.

    * Documentation and JCL updated to include option to use z/OS
      1.2 C compiler for FTPC118/119.  The z/OS 1.2 compiler is
      now the default for FTPC119.

    * New C program NICKNC.  This is a piece of fun designed to
      generate English nicknames.

    * The following new programs are included.

o ANFUXMSG (ASM) An improved WTO message exit for IBM Infoprint
Server.

o HPNSTST (ASM) A program to 'IVP' TCPIP HPNS API.

o RXMAILER (REXX) A bulk emailer which opens a connection to an
SMTP server and transmits SMTP format input data.  This is
similar in many ways to UDSMTP, but RXMAILER has some interesting
features.  It can simulate the sending of emails to stress test
an SMTP server and it can generate parts of the SMTP commands,
SMTP header and mail data at run-time from symbolics (including
interpreted REXX) in the input file.

    *   Minor update to doc and comments including tidy up of
        formatting in $DOCFTPC to reduce file size.
    *   Recompile of C programs to remove TEST option and
        decrease object module size.
