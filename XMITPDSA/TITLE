* Name: xxxxxxxxxxxxx
*
* Abstract:
*
*    xxxxxxxxxxxx
*
* Operation:
*
*    xxxxxxxxxxxxx
*
* Environment:
*
*    IBM compatible mainframe (branch relative/immediate instructions
*    must be supported)
*
*    IBM OS/390, z/OS or subsequent operating system
*
* Assembly:
*
*    Use (userid).CBTxxx.FILE600.ASM.PDS(ASMLKED) or similar to
*    assemble and link this program.
*
* Invocation:
*
*    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
*
*
* Notes:
*
*    The assembler code does not use a base register, so the
*    relative/immediate forms of branch instructions must be used.
*
*    To avoid USING conflicts when we have to temporarily provide
*    a base register for some system macros, a literal pool
*    is not available. Static literals must be placed by name in
*    the 'STATIC' section and referenced via a labeled dependent
*    USING by specifying an ST prefix.
