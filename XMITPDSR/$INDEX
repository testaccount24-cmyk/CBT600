RXMAILER - A bulk emailer which opens a
           socket connection to an SMTP server and transmits
           SMTP format input data. This is similar in many
           ways to UDSMTP, but RXMAILER has some interesting
           features. It can simulate the sending of emails
           to stress test an SMTP server and it can generate
           parts of the SMTP commands, SMTP header and mail
           data at run-time from symbolics (including
           interpreted REXX) in the input file.
RXMAILJ  - Sample JCL to run RXMAILER.
