Footnote
--------
My employer's mainframe is due to be decommissioned at the end of 2006.
After this time, I will most likely be unable the submissions
for CBT tape file 600. It will be with sadness and regret that I
bid farewell to the venerable mainframe which has been my bread and
butter for nearly 20 years!
